# My Solutions to the NYC DOE Data Science Task

In this repository are several files relating to my solutions to my job applications task. The files I would recommend for reading are the .**md** or the .**pdf** files. 

The .rmd file does not display images or text well, but I include it so that the analyses an easily be run on any machine to verify the results. 

These solutions are entirely my own work and are not meant to be reproduced by other applicants for this role.
