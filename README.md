# My Solutions to the NYC DOE Data Science Task

# Please note: part of the assessment was to post the solutions on a public github repository, I would not share the solutions online if I were not asked to. 

In this repository are several files relating to my solutions to my job applications task. The files I would recommend for reading are the .**md** or the .**pdf** files. 

The .rmd file does not display images or text well, but I include it so that the analyses can easily be run on any machine to verify the results. 

These solutions are entirely my own work and are not meant to be reproduced by other applicants for this role.
